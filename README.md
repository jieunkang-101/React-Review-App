## 1. Description
A React application that allows a user to complete a survey. Users should be able to create new surveys while other users should have the ability to fill out those surveys. 

### :small_orange_diamond: Implemented the following features:
* A user should be able to create, update and delete a survey. All surveys should be stored in the database.
* A user should be able to fill out and submit surveys. Survey results should be submitted to the database. (A survey result can be associated to a survey by mimicking a one-to-many relationship.)
A user should be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
* A user should have their own dashboard which lists the surveys they've created.
* Bonus: A user should be able to see the combined data on a survey in their dashboard. For instance, if a survey provides a 1-5 rating, return an average rating for all surveys.
* Challenging: Try using a library like D3 to visualize data from surveys. This is only recommended if you have time to spare, interest in data visualization, and are doing a week-long project.
